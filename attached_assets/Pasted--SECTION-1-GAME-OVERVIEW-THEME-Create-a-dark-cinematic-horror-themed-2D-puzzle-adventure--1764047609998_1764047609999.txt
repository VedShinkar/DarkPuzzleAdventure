📌 SECTION 1 — GAME OVERVIEW & THEME

Create a dark, cinematic, horror-themed 2D puzzle adventure game titled “The Phantom of the Powerbound Manor.”

The game takes place inside a haunted Victorian mansion charged with unstable electrical energy.



The world aesthetic includes:

Realistic fog & smoky shadows

Lightning flashes & flickering lights

Blue–cyan electricity glow

Red ghostly runes

Metallic, Victorian UI

Human-like ghosts appearing between puzzles

Electrically-corrupted circuits

The player selects one of two characters (male/female explorer) and progresses through 5 levels, each representing a different electrical engineering concept.

At the end of each level, a ghost appears and explains the electrical formula or physics principle used in that level.

📌 SECTION 2 — LEVEL-BY-LEVEL MECHANICS WITH FULL MATH RULES

🟨 LEVEL 1 — ENTRY HALL

Concept: Ohm’s Law (V = I × R)

Puzzle Mechanics:

The player sees a flickering lamp.

A UI shows:

A Voltage slider (0–12 V)

A Resistance slider (1–20 Ω)

The game must compute current using Ohm’s Law:

I = V / R

The lamp stabilizes when current falls within a target range:

Target Current: 0.18 A to 0.22 A

When the player reaches the correct current range:

Lamp brightness stabilizes

Sound of electrical hum becomes smooth

A small spark appears in one corner (simple click repair)

Ghost Explanation:

“You unknowingly used Ohm’s Law — V = I × R…”

🟧 LEVEL 2 — STUDY ROOM

Concept: Mixed Currents (Parallel vs Series Circuits)

Mechanics:

Two devices:



Fan (needs more current)

Lamp (needs less current)

Players manipulate two branch resistors.



Math Rules:

Parallel Current Formula:

Itotal=I1+I2I_{total} = I_1 + I_2

Itotal

​=I1

​+I2

​

For each branch:

I=V/RI = V / R

I=V/R

Target Conditions:



Fan current: 0.3 A ± 0.05

Lamp current: 0.12 A ± 0.03

When both currents fall into the required target ranges, the room stabilizes.



Short Circuit Event:

Random sparks appear in bookshelf wires; player must tap them.

🟥 LEVEL 3 — WORKSHOP

Concept: Series–Parallel Hybrid Circuit

Mechanics:

Three branches, each requiring balanced current.



Math Rules:

Series Resistance:

Rseries=R1+R2R_{series} = R_1 + R_2

Rseries

​=R1

​+R2

​

Parallel Equivalent Resistance:

1Rparallel=1Ra+1Rb+…\frac{1}{R_{parallel}} = \frac{1}{R_a} + \frac{1}{R_b} + \dots



Rparallel

​

1

​=Ra

​

1

​+Rb

​

1

​+…

Target Conditions:



Total circuit current must be within 0.25 A ± 0.02

All branches must be within 10% balance tolerance

Power Mechanics:

Fan motor rotates at speed proportional to power:

P=V×IP = V × I

P=V×I

Spectral Surge:

3–5 random hot nodes appear; player scans using a thermal lens UI.

🟦 LEVEL 4 — GENERATOR WING

Concept: High Voltage Stability & Precision Tuning

Mechanics:

Voltage fluctuates automatically ±30%.



Player must continuously apply resistance adjustments.

Math Rules:

Desired Power must be 5.0 W ± 0.1 W

Voltage fluctuates:

V(t)=Vbase+noise(−3,+3)V(t) = V_{base} + \text{noise}(-3,+3)

V(t)=Vbase

​+noise(−3,+3)

Your engine must recompute:

I=V/RI = V / R

I=V/R

P=V×IP = V × I

P=V×I

Short Storm:

Every 2 seconds, new short circuits appear randomly.

🟩 LEVEL 5 — PHANTOM CORE

Concept: Multi-device Power Distribution

Mechanics:

Three devices:



Lamp → needs 1.5W ± 0.05W

Motor → needs 3.0W ± 0.1W

Beacon → needs 4.0W ± 0.1W

Player has:



3 voltage sliders

3 resistor sliders

Each device uses:

P=V×(V/R)P = V × (V / R)

P=V×(V/R)

All three must be solved AT THE SAME TIME.

📌 SECTION 3 — ELECTRICAL SIMULATION CORE LOGIC

The AI should simulate electrical systems using these formulas:



Ohm’s Law



I = V / R

Power Law



P = V * I

Series Resistance



R_total = R1 + R2 + R3...

Parallel Resistance



1/R_total = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + 1/R3

Brightness Mapping



brightness = clamp(P / P_max, 0, 1)

Fan Speed Mapping



speed = k * I

Beacon Power Mapping



glow = P / targetPower

The AI/game engine must recompute these values every frame.
